I've been deploying a micro-blogging sub-section of my blog similar to **Whisper** since shortly after my introduction to independent blogging. The main difference is that it is a self-talking, **defense of the desire to express** as opposed to a long blog post. The initial role was to back up QZone, Twitter and Weibo, etc. The earliest micro-blogging program I used was PageCookery, then I used Wordpress and Typecho's custom theme, I used "[b speech b language](https://bb.daibor.com/)", I used [Memos](https://memos.eallion.com), and now I use [{{< icon "mastodon" >}} Mastodon](https://e5n.cc) , tool: [{{< icon "gitlab" >}} Mastodon embed timeline](https://gitlab.com/idotj/mastodon-embed-timeline) .
