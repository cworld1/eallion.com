### Sonnet 141

> William Shakespeare

In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But `tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue`s tune delighted;
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone.
But my five wits, nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart`s slave and vassal wretch to be.
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

Chinese:
我不真的凭我的眼睛来爱你，
在你身上人们只见千处缺点；
但我的心却爱着眼睛所轻视
溺爱着，不理睬面前的景象。
我耳朵不听你舌尖传的愉悦音色；
我那期待着爱抚的敏感触觉，
我的味觉,我的嗅觉,不愿出席
你的个人的任何感官的宴会。
可是我的五智或五感却不能
说服一个痴心不爱你，
剩下男人那一点不为动摇的，
甘愿做你那高傲之心的奴隶。
然我只能将我爱情悲苦视作益处，
她诱使我犯罪，她令我受苦。
