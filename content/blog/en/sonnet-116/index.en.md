summary: "The article discusses Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, which explores the concept of true love. It emphasizes that love is unchanging and steadfast, unaffected by time or external circumstances.

### Sonnet 116

> William Shakespeare

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fix`ed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his heighth be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

Chinese:
我绝不承认两颗真心的结合
有任何障碍。这样的爱不是真爱
若是遇有变节的机会就改变，
或是被强势剥离就屈服：
哦，那不是爱！爱是坚定的烽火，
凝视着狂涛而不动摇；
爱是向导迷航船只的明星，
高度可测，实价无量。
爱不受时光影响，即使红唇粉颊
终会被岁月的镰刀砍伐；
爱不随分分秒秒、日日月月改变，
爱不畏时间磨炼，直到末日尽头。
如果有人可证明我所解不实，
我从未写过，而无人曾真爱过。
