### Love At First Sight

> Wislawa Szymborska

They both thought

That a sudden feeling had united them.

This certainty is beautiful

Even more beautiful than uncertainty.

They thought they didn’t know each other

Nothing had ever happened between them.

These streets, these stairs, this corridors

Where they could have met so long ago?

I would like to ask them,

If they can remember-

Perhaps in a revolving door

Face to face one day?

A “sorry”in the crowd?

“wrong number”on the phone?

But i know the answer

No, they don’t remember.

How surprised they would be

For such a long time already

Fate has been playing with them.

Not quite yet ready

To change into destiny.

Which brings them nearer and yet furrher

Cutting their path

And stifling a laugh

Escaping ever further.

There were sings, indications, undecipherable, what does in matter.

Three years ago, perhaps or even last Tuesday

This leaf flying from one shoulder to another?

Something lost and gathered?

Who knows , perhaps a ball already in the bushes, in childhood?

There were handles, door bells

Where, on the trace of a hand.

Another hand was placed

Suitcases next to one another in the left luggage.

And maybe one night the same dream

Forgotten on walking.

But every beginning

Is only a continuation.

And the book of fate is

Always open in the middle.
